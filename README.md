### Hi there, I'm Andreas!

PhD in theoretical physics specializing in **computational many-body methods** (tensor networks, exact diagonalization, Monte Carlo). My work focuses on moiré systems and large-scale numerical simulations, and I enjoy building high-performance Julia libraries for scientific computing, quantitative modeling, and industry applications.

### About me

- Researcher at the University of Wuerzburg working on moiré materials and strongly correlated electrons using tensor-network and Monte Carlo methods.
- Interested in roles at the intersection of physics, software engineering, and quantitative finance, especially where numerical modeling, HPC, and rigorous data-driven decision making matter.

### Skills

- Languages and tools: Julia, Python, Linux, HPC/MPI, Git
- Methods: Tensor networks (MPS/iMPS), exact diagonalization, Monte Carlo for quantum many-body systems
- Strengths: Numerical optimization, algorithm design, scientific software architecture, open-source collaboration

### What I'm currently working on

- Maintaining and developing many-body methods and generic Julia packages in the open-source organization [ManyBodyLab](https://www.manybodylab.com/):
  - Infinite tensor-network algorithms (e.g. iDMRG, MPO-compression) based on [ITensors.jl](https://github.com/ITensor/ITensors.jl)
  - MPI-parallelized tensor-network algorithms in [MPSKitParallel.jl](https://github.com/ManyBodyLab/MPSKitParallel.jl)
  - High-performance exact diagonalization tools
  - Monte Carlo for quantum many-body systems using [Carlo.jl](https://github.com/lukas-weber/Carlo.jl)
- Designing modular backends to support multiple tensor-network libraries, improving flexibility and reuse across projects and reducing duplication in downstream codes.
  - [TensorKitAdapters.jl](https://github.com/ManyBodyLab/TensorKitAdapters.jl) & [MPSKitAdapters.jl](https://github.com/ManyBodyLab/MPSKitAdapters.jl)
- Contributing to [MPSKit.jl](https://github.com/QuantumKitHub/MPSKit.jl) and [ITensors.jl](https://github.com/ITensor/ITensors.jl), abstracting code and improving performance and maintainability.

### Interests and goals

- Applying physics-inspired numerical methods to:
  - Quantitative finance (stochastic simulation, time-series modeling, portfolio and risk analysis)
  - Large-scale scientific computing and optimization
- Building robust, well-documented open-source tools that can be used beyond a single research project.
